# Baking App (Bakers Corner)

This is 4th project in Android Developer Nanodegree by Udacity

### App Description

Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images you will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.

One of the skills you will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.

### What I Learnt from the App

- Use Simple ExoPlayer to play videos
- To handle different API errors
- Use widget to enhance App experience
- Use fragments to support both phones and tablets layouts.
